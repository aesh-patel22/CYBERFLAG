# CYBERFLAG
CYBERFLAG - Capture the flag, Capture the Fun Cyber Flag is a cyber security based CTF model developed for our TechFest competition. This project was created using PHP, HTML and JavaScript, and is designed to test real cyber security skills, logical reasoning, and problem-solving abilities.

📂 Challenge Categories
The platform is divided into several focus areas, each designed to challenge a different part of the hacker's mindset:

🌐 Web Exploitation: Dive into PHP-based vulnerabilities, SQL injections, and server misconfigurations.

🔡 ASCII & Encodings: Decipher hidden messages hidden within ASCII art and unconventional character sets.

🛠️ Reverse Engineering: Analyze provided source code and system logic to find the "hidden path" to the flag.

🧠 Logical Thinking: Multi-step puzzles that require more than just technical skill—they require a sharp, analytical mind.

🎨 Color Detection & Stego: Challenges involving hexadecimal color manipulation, pixel data, and visual steganography.

🛠️ Technology Stack
Backend: PHP

Database: MySQL (MariaDB)

Frontend: Tailwind CSS

Server Config: Apache (.htaccess)
